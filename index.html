        <p class="quotes">Technology is a powerful tool, but its true value lies in how we use it. While it has the potential to solve problems and improve lives, its impact depends on our intentions and actions. In fields like healthcare, communication, and sustainability, technology can drive positive change when applied responsibly. However, without careful consideration, it can also create unintended consequences. To ensure that technology benefits society, we must use it ethically, focusing on promoting equity, well-being, and sustainability. Our choices shape its role in the future.</p>
